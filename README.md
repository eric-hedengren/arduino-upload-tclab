# For Arduino Firmware Updates

Use arduinos desktop app to generate a new ino hex file if want to update the firmware code before uploading. If you plug in an arduino and run the code with the app preferences set to show upload details, it will display the location of the cached ino hex file. Copy that file to the same folder as the python file that uploads the firmware, and you're all set.
